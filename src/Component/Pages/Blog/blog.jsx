            With great excitement our team hosted our annual Spring Crawfish
            Boil and Cornhole Tournament! Though the weather was questionable,
            the food was anything but! Our Estimators, Project managers,
            Executives, and Accounting departments all gathered outside for the
            feast. We look forward to this event every year and love to enjoy
            the food, fellowship, and fun with our team!

            This week we attended our first in-person career fair since 2015!
            The socially distant event took place at the McWhorter School of
            Building Science at Auburn University. In addition to our visit to
            Auburn, our team participated in several virtual career fairs
            online. Our team provides hands on internships for college students
            every summer.
